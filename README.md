### What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to practice responsive web design and enhance my skills in HTML and CSS. I learned how to effectively use media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes and how to implement hover states to improve user interaction.

Continued Development
In future projects, I want to focus more on integrating JavaScript to add dynamic content and interactions. I'm also interested in exploring CSS animations to enhance the user experience.
